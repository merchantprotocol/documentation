Assume that your website has 3 store views: English, German and French. You wish to have unique prices of the Product A for each distinct store view. For example:

Product | English |	German |	French
----- | ----- | ----- | -----
Product A Price	| $10 | $9 | $8

To do this, go to:

In administrator panel: Catalog -> Manage Products -> Edit Product -> Choose a Store View. You’ll get a notification: Please confirm the site switching. All data that hasn’t been saved will be lost. Confirm it.

![Store Pricing – Edit Product – Prices](store-pricing-product-edit-price.png) 

Remove the check from the box labelled "Use Default" which relates to the Price field. Now enter a price for the product A and press Save or Save and Continue Edit. You can repeat the procedure for any other selected store view, entering a desired product price.
