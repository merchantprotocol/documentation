Set up your payment groups and assign payment methods to your groups:

![Payment Groups Admin](paymentgroups.png) 

Here, you create your Pricing Groups. Inside of each Pricing Group, there are Payment Methods. For example, I have the Payment Groups: Offline Payment & Debit Card:

![Payment Groups](payment_method_pricing_groups.png)

Next, set the specific Payment Methods for that Payment Group. For example, you would put Cash on Delivery and/or No Payment Information Required for the Offline Payment Group. Simply hold Ctrl and click the Payment Methods you want. You can specify the Position for each Payment Group 1 or 2, it doesn't affect anything.

Once your payment groups are ready, set your products prices as needed:

![Product Edit Prices](prices.png) 

On the product's front end, the payment group prices will be displayed:

In the cart, users can select the payment methods they want to use and the prices will reflect their selected payment method:

You need to have symlinks allowed in the System -> Configuration -> Advanced:
