Payment Method Pricing is a Magento extension that allows you to set prices based on the type of payment method that the user will pay with. For example, if the user wants to pay with Wire Transfer, there would be no cost to you so you can sell the product as a lower price. Conversely, if the user wants to pay with credit card or PayPal, there would a fee incurred on you, so you may want to adjust the pricing for that product.
