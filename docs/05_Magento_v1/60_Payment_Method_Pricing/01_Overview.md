The Payment Method Pricing is a Magento extension that allows you to set prices based on the type of payment method that the client uses. For example, if the user wants to pay with a Wire Transfer, there would be no cost to you so you can sell the product at a lower price. Conversely, if the user wants to pay with a credit card or PayPal, you would incur a fee, so you may want to adjust the pricing for that product.
