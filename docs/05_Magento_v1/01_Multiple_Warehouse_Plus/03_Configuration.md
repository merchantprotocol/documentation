#### Mode

You can choose between two modes: Multiple and Single. Say you have a web store configured with multiple warehouses. The shop administrator, selecting one of the two modes, can allow shipping from multiple warehouses or from a single warehouse, previously assigned to a customer. We’ll talk about it in the following article.

#### Enable Shipping Methods Filtering

As you know, there are different shipping methods such as: Flat rate, Table rate, FedEx, UPS, USPS, Canada Post, Royal Post, Free Shipping and so on. This option allows you to filter available shipping methods for each warehouse individually. For instance, for a Canada warehouse you can apply Canada Post as the only available shipping method. Fedex, USPS, etc are US specific shipping methods. If set to Yes, the option is enabled. If the option is set to No then the filtering will be disabled. If option is enabled then the Shipping Methods tab comes available to edit the warehouse page.

#### Enable Discount

Any of your products can be listed in several warehouses. With this option, you will be able to offer discounts for the same product, depending on the warehouse. Hence, you will have a different product price for each warehouse. Yes – the option is enabled. No – the option is disabled. If the option is enabled then the Price Adjustment field becomes available for editting in the Prices tab.
