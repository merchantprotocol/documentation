We will describe how to add more currencies to the system here. Please note, this feature is the standard Magento Community Edition function.

In administrator panel: System -> Configuration -> General -> Currency Setup -> Allowed Currency .

Choose as many currencies as you need. If you have a wide range of international consumers you will need a list of all your customers money units. Make the list of all required currencies.

In administrator panel: System -> Manage Currency Rates .

Now you can set the currency rates that are beneficial (most appropriate) to you manually or import rates from a service like Webservicex. Save results and regenerate the Product Prices index.

So, you can choose as many currencies as you want. But if your currency list is too long you may limit it in order to let your customer select currencies from the short list of monetary units which are common in their region. In addition, the system will automatically display products price in visitor native currency. For example you have a list of 20 currencies. A visitor from, say, Germany doesnâ€™t need to see prices in Japanese Yen and so on. Shorten this list by setting only two currencies (or more) for Germany: USD and EUR. Now when the German customer comes to your site he will browse items price in EUR or select US currency from the drop down list. You can perform such tasks by using Currency Geo Filter extension additionally. Currency Geo Filter detects your visitors geo-location by IP address, automatically converts prices in customer currencies and offers only the most spread monetary units of a given area.
