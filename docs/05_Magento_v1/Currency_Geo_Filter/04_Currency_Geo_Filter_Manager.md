You will find the Currency Geo Filter manager page under System -> Currency Geo Filter in administrator panel.

![Currency Geo Filter - Manager](currency-geo-filter-manager.png) 

This screen allows you to assign each currency to multiple countries. 

### The country assigned to multiple currencies

Some currencies are assigned to the same country in this case. The visitor will be permitted to select the most appropriate currency allowed. The first matching currency enabled by default will be selected, unless the default store currency is present in the allowed currency list. For example, an administrator selects Germany for Euro and US Dollar currencies. Then any visitor coming from a Germany address has 2 currency switcher options: Euro and US Dollar. Euro is active by default, as the first matching currency, unless the US dollar is the default store currency

### The country assigned to the single currency

The system currently switches automatically, and no currency switcher is displayed for the visitor. For example, Germany was selected for the Euro currency only. Visitors coming from Germany are seeing prices in Euro and no currency switcher box is displaying in this case.

### The country is not assigned to any currency

The default currency will be applied to visitors and no currency switcher box will be displayed.
