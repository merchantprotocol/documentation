### Setting Price Scope

Advanced Pricing appends Store View product price scope in addition to Global and Website.

In administrator panel: System -> Configuration -> Catalog -> Catalog -> Price -> Catalog Price Scope.

Select scope and save configuration. Once price scope is changed system reindexes Product Prices data and resets the scope for the next product attributes: Price, Special Price, Special Price From Date, Special Price To Date, Tier Price

### Price

You can define the product price for each store view separately.

In administrator panel: Catalog -> Manage Products -> Edit Product -> Prices -> Price.

Select the store view with store view selector. You can set price here. Uncheck Use Default Value flag and enter value. Besides Price you can set Price per Currency for each currency and store view individually.

Now when a customer comes to your store and selects the store view he will see next:
