Our Advanced Pricing Magento extension allows you to manage product prices in a very flexible way. In particular, it allows you to set product prices in different currencies independently of currency rates. You can, at your own discretion, adjust any given product price in different monetary units, for example, you can set charm prices instead of calculated by rates. Besides, the administrator can set product prices for each store view separately. In other words, the extension appends the Store View's product price scope in addition to Website and Global. Another essential feature of Advanced Pricing is Zone Discounts that can be offered according to visitor’s geographical location. It enables discounts for zones (areas / locations / countries / regions /states), by providing either fixed or percentage discounts for a particular product.

Advanced Pricing combines the features of our three extensions: Currency Pricing, Zone Pricing and Store View Pricing. Such combination allows you to get the most advantageous price – location – store view – currency relationship. You can change prices of a product as you wish:

 - Set price per currency
 - Set price per store view
 - Set special price per currency
 - Set special price per store view
 - Recalculate prices by a certain currency automatically
 - Tier price per currency
