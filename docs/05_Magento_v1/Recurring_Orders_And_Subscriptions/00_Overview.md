## Recurring Orders and Subscriptions

This extension is designed to manage subscriptions that require orders to be created at a certain interval. For example, if you're selling Shoes you could let customers sign up for a "Monthly Surprise Shoe Box" and this extension would create a new order for the customer and charge their card each month.
