Admin Panel: Reports -> Products -> Low Stock

The system indicates which product's inventory is running low and in which warehouse. Select a warehouse and the amount per product you wish your Magento store to regard as a low quantity amount. If this quantity amount is reached, the Multi-Warehouse will display all items that have fallen below the minimum stock level, and indicate the warehouse in which these items are stored.
