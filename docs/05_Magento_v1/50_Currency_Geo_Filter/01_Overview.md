Our Currency Geo Filter extension provides flexible location-based currency control. It gives you the ability to split allowed store currencies by countries and accommodates visitors with currencies in a desirable way. The store administrator is allowed to set the single currency. It also lets users choose from the list depending on the country the visitor came from (or by shipping / billing addresses optionally). The visitorâ€™s location is tracked by the Customer Locator built-in extension.
