Hidden Guest Registration can cause a lot of problems and lost sales if not completed properly. Our hidden registration extension does not interfere with the checkout process, it does not try to quietly log users in or modify the checkout process in any way. This extension is perfectly stable because we wait until the order has been completely processed and the checkout is finished before triggering the registration. Once the order has been completed, our extension goes to work creating the customer account from the guest order information and then associating the created orders with the newly created / found customer account.
