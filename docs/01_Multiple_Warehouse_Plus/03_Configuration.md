#### Mode

You can choose between two modes: Multiple and Single. Say, you have a web store configured with multiple warehouses. The shop administrator, selecting one of the two modes, can allow shipping either from multiple warehouses (Multiple) or from a single warehouse (Single), previously assigned to a customer. We’ll talk about it in the following article.

#### Enable Shipping Methods Filtering

As you know, there are different shipping methods such as: Flat rate, Table rate, FedEx, UPS, USPS, Canada Post, Royal Post, Free Shipping and so on. This option makes possible to filter available shipping methods for each warehouse individually. For instance, for a Canada warehouse you can apply Canada Post as only available shipping method. And Fedex, USPS, etc are US specific shipping methods. If set to Yes, the option is enabled. If the option is set to No then the filtering will be disabled. If option is enabled then Shipping Methods tab comes available for edit warehouse page.

#### Enable Discount

Any of your products can be listed in several warehouses. With this option, you will be able to offer discounts for the same product, depending on warehouse. Hence you will have a different product price for each warehouse. Yes – the option is enabled. No – the option is disabled. If the option is enabled then Price Adjustment field comes available for edit in product Prices tab.
