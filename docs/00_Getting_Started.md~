## Getting Started

### Download

Download this repository as a zip, and unpack. Copy the files to a web server that can run PHP 5.3 or greater.
You can also run the documentation locally using Grunt.js, which is covered at the end of this readme.

If you don't intend to modify Daux.io and just want to use it, you only need to copy `resources`, `daux.phar`, `global.json`, `generate`, `serve` and `index.php` With these, you're ready to create your documentation.

If however you wish to do some advanced modifications, I recommend you use the raw version and run `composer install` to get started.

### Writing pages

Creating new pages is very easy:
1. Create a markdown file (`*.md` or `*.markdown`)
2. Start writing

By default, the generator will look for folders in the `docs` folder.
Add your folders inside the `docs` folder. This project contains some example folders and files to get you started.

You can nest folders any number of levels to get the exact structure you want.
The folder structure will be converted to the nested navigation.

You must use underscores instead of spaces. Here are some example file names and what they will be converted to:

**Good:**

* 01_Getting_Started.md = Getting Started
* API_Calls.md = API Calls
* 200_Something_Else-Cool.md = Something Else-Cool
* _5_Ways_to_Be_Happy.md = 5 Ways To Be Happy

**Bad:**

* File Name With Space.md = FAIL

### See your pages

Now you can see your pages. you have two options for that : serve them directly, or generate to various formats.

We recommend the first one while you write your documentation, you get a much quicker feedback while writing.

#### Serving files

You can use PHP's embedded web server by running the following command in the root of your documentation

```
./serve
```

Upload your files to an apache / nginx server and see your documentation

[More informations here](!Features/Live_mode)

#### Export to other formats

Daux.io is extendable and comes by default with three export formats:

- Export to HTML, same as the website, but can be hosted without PHP.
- Export all documentation in a single HTML page
- Upload to your Atlassian Confluence server.

[See a detailed feature comparison matrix](!Features/Multiple_Output_Formats)

Here's how you run an export:

```bash
./generate
```

[See here for all options](!Features/Static_Site_Generation)
